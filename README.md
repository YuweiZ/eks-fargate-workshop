# EKS Fargate Workshop
Welcome to this workshop that will be centered around using EKS together with Fargate. In the end you should be comfortable creating EKS clusters with pods deployed on Fargate instead on the "normal" EC2 worker nodes.

To get the most of this workshop it is recommended to have some basic knowledge of Kubernetes and AWS to maximize the value that you get.
